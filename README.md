This is a minecraft-clone written in rust. It is made with WGPU and is playable on the web.

## Upcoming features
- Player physics
- ~~Better meshing algorithm~~
- Interesting generation
- LOD meshing

- Maybe try out libloading for loading plugins (idt WASM will cut it, there's no passing mutable data)

## Steps to finish
- ~~Document engine classes~~
- ~~Make better player jump/movement physics~~
- Add ImGui to configure variables
- Add loading screen
- Make sure build works on WASM target
- Be able to add/remove blocks
